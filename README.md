# ATCommandScriptProcessor

Tired of repeatedly typing series of AT or terminal commands? This might help you.

This is a project I did when I was still working at Dangerous Prototypes around 2009.

This saved me (and other people) from repeatedly typing AT commands. This was tested to work with Bus Pirate, GSM modems and ESP8266.
